Buddhism ( BUUD-ih-zÉ™m, US also  BOOD-), also known as Buddhadharma and Dharmavinaya, is an Indian religion and philosophical tradition based on teachings attributed to the Buddha, a wandering teacher who lived in the 6th or 5th century BCE. It is the world's fourth-largest religion, with almost 500 million followers, known as Buddhists, who comprise seven percent of the global population. It arose in the eastern Gangetic plain as a Å›ramaá¹‡a movement in the 5th century BCE, and gradually spread throughout much of Asia. Buddhism has subsequently played a major role in Asian culture and spirituality, eventually spreading to the West in the 20th century.
According to tradition, the Buddha instructed his followers in a path of development which leads to awakening and full liberation from dukkha (lit.â€‰'suffering or unease'). He regarded this path as a Middle Way between extremes such as asceticism or sensual indulgence.
